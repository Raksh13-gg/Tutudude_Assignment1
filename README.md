# Python Basics - Simple Programs

This repository contains two simple Python programs written as beginner-friendly tasks.  
The programs focus on **basic arithmetic operations** and **string concatenation**.


## Task 1: Arithmetic Operations

**Description:**  
This program takes two numbers as input from the user and performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with division by zero handling)

**Code Flow:**
1. User enters the first and second number.
2. Program calculates sum, difference, product, and quotient.
3. If the second number is zero, the division result will be `"Undefined (division by zero)"`.
4. Results are displayed on the screen.

**Example Run:**
Enter the first number:
10
Enter the second number:
5
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0

## Task 2: Name Concatenation

**Description:**  
This program takes two names (first name and second name) as input, concatenates them into a full name, and displays a personalized greeting.

**Code Flow:**
1. User enters their first and second name.
2. Program concatenates the names with a space in between.
3. A greeting message is displayed.

**Example Run:**
enter the first name:
Rakshita
enter the second name:
Upadhyaya
Hello Rakshita Upadhyaya! Welcome to the Python program
